to do:

rework queue system?
if request requires a response don't send any more requests until they respond. Can keep sending the same request after certian period of time

some pictures not showing up

search bar only searches property address, mls, seller name or phone numbre, upcoming showing

if seller doesn't respond to showing request w/i a certain amount of time
	-> if past requested time cancel showing and send message to buyers agent

twilio number implimentation
	-> signing up
	-> sending messages

timezone implementation

reset password stuff

notification when lock box is opened??
buyers agent cancel or re-schedule??

clean up code
